title: PSP debugging (PSPLink)
---

#### Setup

1. Check out PSPLink
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/pspdev/psplinkusb.git
    cd psplinkusb
    ```

1. Apply workaround

    https://github.com/pspdev/psplinkusb/issues/7

1. Compile
    ```
    docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/build" bmaupin/pspdev:gcc-4.6.4 make release
    ```

1. Copy psplinkusb/release_oe/psplink/ to PSP/GAME on the PSP


#### Debugging

1. Connect PSPLink
    1. On the PSP, open PSPLINK

    1. In a terminal on your PC, CD to folder where the .prx file is you want to run
        ```
        cd /path/to/somewhere
        ```

    1. Start USB connection
        ```
        docker run -it --rm --privileged -v /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb -v "$PWD:/build" bmaupin/pspdev:gcc-4.6.4 usbhostfs_pc
        ```

    1. Wait for this message:
        ```
        Connected to device
        ```

    1. In a **second terminal**, connect to the PSP
        ```
        docker container exec -it $(docker container ls | grep usbhostfs_pc | awk '{print $1}') pspsh
        ```

1. Debug
    1. In a **third terminal**, start gdb on the .elf file you want to debug
        ```
        $ docker container exec -it $(docker container ls | grep usbhostfs_pc | awk '{print $1}') psp-gdb retroarchpsp.elf
        ```
        ```
        (gdb) target remote :10001
        ```

        Ignore these errors:
        ```
        Ignoring packet error, continuing...
        warning: unrecognized item "timeout" in "qSupported" response
        ```

    1. In the **second terminal** (where you ran `pspsh`)
        ```
        host0:/> debug retroarchpsp.prx
        ```

        - If you were successful, you should see something like this in the **third terminal**:
            ```
            0x0880413c in module_start ()
            ```

            If you see something like this instead, then go back and make sure your program was compiled with debugging symbols:
            ```
            0x0880413c in ?? ()
            ```

    1. In the **third terminal**
        1. If the app you're debugging isn't crashing, set a breakpoint somewhere
            ```
            (gdb) b nameoffunction
            ```

        1. Type `c` to start debugging
            ```
            (gdb) c
            ```

        If it gets stuck (it never returns to the (gdb) prompt), press Ctrl-C twice

        Some helpful gdb commands:

        - `n` - Go line-by-line without stepping into functions
        - `s` - Go line-by-line and step into functions
        - `finish` - Go until the end of the current function
