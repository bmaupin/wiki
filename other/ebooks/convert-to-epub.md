#### Convert a webpage to EPUB

Use [dotEPUB](http://dotepub.com/)

#### Convert MOBI to EPUB

1. Install and open [Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/)

2. Drag the file into Calibre to add it

3. Right-click the book in the list of books > _Convert books_ > _Convert individually_

4. In the _Metadata_ section adjust the title and author as desired

5. Change the settings in _EPUB Output_ as desired

6. Under _Page setup_ set _Output profile_ to _Tablet_ (this will disable resizing of images)

7. Click _OK_

8. The generated EPUB will be located in your home folder/Calibre Library/_author_/_title_

#### Convert document (.doc, .docx, .odt, .rtf) to EPUB

- Using Calibre

  This will preserve most formatting (text styling, line spacing, font, text size, line justification).

  1. Install and open [Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/)

  2. If it's a .doc file, open it in LibreOffice and save it as a .docx file first

     **Note:** Calibre can convert .odt files directly to EPUB, but the results may be better if they're converted to .docx first

  3. It's best to edit the paragraphs so there's spacing between them. In LibreOffice:

     1. _Edit_ > _Select All_
     2. _Format_ > _Paragraph_
     3. _Spacing_ > _Above paragraph_ > 0.50 cm (or 0.19")
     4. _Spacing_ > _Below paragraph_ > 0.50 cm (or 0.19") > _OK_

  4. _Add books_ > browse to the .docx or .rtf file > Open

  5. Right-click the document in the list of books > _Convert books_ > _Convert individually_

  6. In the _Metadata_ section adjust the title and author as desired

  7. If you don't want an autogenerated cover, go to the _EPUB Output_ section and check _No default cover_

  8. Click _OK_

  9. The generated EPUB will be located in your home folder/Calibre Library/_author_/_title_

- Using pandoc

  This will preserve basic text styling (bold, italics, etc) but lose most other formatting.

  ```
  pandoc -o output.epub input.docx
  ```

  To set the title/author:

  ```
  pandoc -o output.epub input.docx -M author="Fartrell Cluggins" -M title="The Greatest Book Ever Written"
  ```
