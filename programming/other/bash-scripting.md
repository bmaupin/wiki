## Variables

#### `$?`
Return value of last run process


#### `$1`
The first argument passed to the script


#### `$0`
The name of the script


#### Declaring variables
To declare a variable within a script:
```
myvariable="value"
```

**Note:** do not put spaces before or after equals sign!

To declare a variable outside a script that is to be used within a script:
```
export myvariable="value"
```

Or pass it at the same time you call the script (which only declares it for the context of the script):
```
myvariable="value" ./myscript
```


#### Using variables
```
echo "This is my variable: ${myvariable}"
```


#### Check to make sure a variable is set and not null
```
if [ -n "$1" ]
```


#### Check the value of a variable
```
if [ "$LOCATION" == "home" ]; then
```
- Spaces padding brackets and equals signs are required!
- Use `[]` instead of `[[]]`
- Always quote variable names, otherwise the script will crash if the variable isn't set
- Use `==` for equality and `!=` for inequality for strings, `-eq` and `-ne` for integers. [Other comparison operators](http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/comparison-ops.html)



## Output redirection

#### `>`
Redirect stdout


#### `>/dev/null`
Don't show stdout


#### `2>`
Redirect stderr


#### `2>&1`
Direct stderr to stdout


#### `&>`
Redirect all output



## Conditionals

#### If statements

```
if [ condition ]; then
elif...
fi
```


#### And/or
```
if [ condition ] && [ condition ] || [ condition ]; then
...
```


#### Case statements
Example from an init script:
```
case "$1" in
    start)
    start
    RETVAL=$?
    ;;
    stop)
    stop
    RETVAL=$?
    ;;
    restart)
    stop
    start
    ;;
esac
```


#### Check if a directory exists
```
if [ -d /path/to/folder ]; then
fi
```


#### Check if a file exists
```
if [ -f /path/to/file ]; then
fi
```


#### Check if a file exists and is readable
```
if [ -r /path/to/file ]; then
fi
```


#### Check if a file exists and is executable
```
if [ -x /path/to/file ]; then
fi
```



## Command-line arguments

#### First argument
```
$1
```


#### Second argument
```
$2
```


#### Number of arguments
```
$#
```



## Scripting tips

#### Copying
Use:
```
/bin/cp -f
```

Because often vendors will alias cp so that it will always ask before overwriting files:
```
$ alias cp
alias cp='cp -i'
```


#### Preventing errors when performing actions that have already been done
Use alternate versions of some of these common commands:
```
ln -fs
mkdir -p
rm -f
```


#### Environment variables
Make sure to export environment variables if they're needed by a command in your script (and not just used internally by your script):
```
export http_proxy=http://proxy.example.org:3128/
export https_proxy=http://proxy.example.org:3128/
```


#### telnet
```
sleep 0 | telnet server.example.org 22 || true
```



## Misc

#### For loops

```
list="item1 item2"
for item in $list; do
    do something with $item
done
```


#### `|| :`
Placed at the end of a command to force the exit status to 0 (success)


#### `$(dirname $0)`
Get name of directory script resides in
