#### Deleting a local branch
```
git branch -d BRANCH_NAME
```


#### Deleting a remote branch
```
git push origin --delete BRANCH_NAME
```



## Other

#### Interactive rebasing/squashing

**Warning:** Rebasing should only be done on feature branches that nobody else is working on

1. (Optional) Create a backup branch
    ```
    git checkout -b backup
    ```

    Then switch back to the branch you want to rebase

1. Find the commit ID of the last commit you want to keep

1. Start an interactive rebase
    ```
    git rebase -i COMMIT_ID
    ```

    Ex:
    ```
    git rebase -i 91b49d38
    ```

1. Go through the list of commits and change `pick` as desired
    - `squash` is typically going to be the most useful option. It will take changes from that commit and add them to
      the previous commit.
        - It will make sure all changes get included without any conflicts and still gives you the opportunity to edit
          the commit message starting with the first `pick` as long as there's at least one `squash` after it (not
          counting any `fixup` commits before or after the `squash`).
        - If you don't want to change the previous commit, use `squash` or `fixup` with the next commit instead. **Don't
          use `drop`** because it will result in conflicts since it will try to apply changes to pieces of the file that
          may have been dropped.
        - Since `squash` merges changes into the previous commit, it can't be used for the first commit ID in a rebase.
    - `fixup` is really only useful for commits where you were testing or fixing typos and you're absolutely certain you
      don't want to use the commit message.
        - `squash` is typically still better because a `pick` followed by only `fixup` commits won't give you the
          opportunity to edit the commit message.
    - Commit IDs will be changed starting with the first commit where you use something other than `pick`.
    - If you simply close the interactive rebase screen, nothing will be changed.

1. Fix any conflicts as needed
    1. List the conflicted files
        ```
        git status
        ```

    1. Edit and save the conflicted files

    1. Use `git add` to mark the conflicted file as resolved. Ex:
        ```
        git add README.md
        ```

    1. Resume the rebase
        ```
        git rebase --continue
        ```

1. Push the rebased branch

    Use `--force` if this branch has already been pushed remotely

1. Delete the backup branch
    ```
    git branch -d backup
    ```
