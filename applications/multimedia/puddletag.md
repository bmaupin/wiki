- You can also select a tag for multiple tracks using shift-click and paste the same value into all selected tracks

#### Renaming files

1. Put this in the text box near the upper left:
   - For Track number - Title:
     ```
     $num(%track%,2) - %title%
     ```
   - For Artist - Title:
     ```
     %artist% - %title%
     ```
1. Select all tracks to rename
1. Click the _F_ button to the right of the text box

#### Adding album artist column:

1. Right-click column names > _Select Columns..._
1. Click plus sign
1. Title: _Album Artist_
1. Field: _albumartist_
1. In the left, check _Album Artist_
1. _OK_

#### Auto numbering for tracks

1. Select all the tracks to autonumber
1. _Tools_ > _Autonumbering Wizard_ > _OK_

#### Replacing text

1. Select the tracks you want to update
1. _Actions_ > _Functions_ > _Replace_
1. Under _Fields_ choose the field you want to update or _\_\_all_ for all fields
1. Fill in the _Replace_ and _with_ fields > _OK_

#### String formatting

1. Select the tracks you want to update
1. _Actions_ > _Functions_ > _Format value_
1. Under _Fields_ choose the field you want to update or _\_\_all_ for all fields
1. Under _Format string_, you can rename a tag based on the contents of that tag or another tag, for example
   - _Lesson %title%_

## Tags

#### List all tags and versions

_Windows_ > make sure _Stored Tags_ is checked

#### Helpful tags

- Filename without extension: `__filename_no_ext`
  - This can be used, for example, to append a tag to the existing filename, e.g. `%__filename_no_ext% - %title%`

For more tags, see [https://docs.puddletag.net/source/tags.html](https://docs.puddletag.net/source/tags.html)

#### Look up tags using online sources

See also: [Using Tag Sources](https://docs.puddletag.net/source/tagsources.html)

1. _Windows_ > _Tag Sources_
1. (Optional) If other windows are open (e.g. _Artwork_), close them to have more space to work
1. _Source_
   1. Try _AcoustID_ first, which will search by audio fingerprint
   1. If that doesn't work, try _MusicBrainz_ or another source
1. (Skip this step for AcoustID) In the search box you can type _artist; album_, e.g:
   pimsleur; french plus
1. Click _Search_
1. Select all of the tracks you want to update
1. Select an album to preview the changes
1. If you want to apply the updates, click the _Write_ button inside the _Tag Sources_ pane
1. Close the _Tag Sources_ window if desired

If MusicBrainz is giving 404 errors:

1. Go to https://musicbrainz.org and find the album using search (or use a web browser)
   ðŸ‘‰ Make sure to select the appropriate search field as it defaults to _Artist_
1. Copy the UUID from the URL (e.g. _cf81efdc-4b9d-4f84-a742-9a8f42da8014_)
   ðŸ‘‰ Confusingly, this is the MBID, which is different from the album ID that will show in Puddletag
1. In Puddletag, search with this syntax:
   ```
   :b UUID
   ```
   e.g.
   ```
   :b cf81efdc-4b9d-4f84-a742-9a8f42da8014
   ```

#### Add album art

1. If you don't see the _Artwork_ pane on the right, go to _Windows_ and check _Artwork_

1. Follow the steps above to add album art
