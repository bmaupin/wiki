title: Android factory reset
---

If you've had your phone for a year or two and it feels much slower or starts having problems, first try to remove apps you don't use. If that doesn't work, follow these steps to do a factory reset.

1. Make sure everything on your phone is backed up

   1. Make sure all of your settings are backed up

      1. Open the _Settings_ app > _Backup & reset_
      1. Under _Backup account_ make sure the correct account is selected
      1. Make sure _Back up my data_ is checked

   1. Make sure your photos are backed up

      1. Follow the steps for _Unlimited free photo backup_ here: [Android tips](android-tips)
      1. Make sure all of your photos have finished backing up by going to the _Photos_ app > _Menu_ > _Assistant_ and looking for the _Backup complete_ message

   1. Make sure your app data is backed up

      1. Google apps

         1. Go to _Settings_ > _Accounts_ > _Google_
         1. Make sure you have a Google account listed under _Accounts_
         1. Tap your Google account
         1. Make sure everything in the list is enabled to make sure your app data for Google apps is backed up. This includes all Google apps in the list, like Keep, as well as all of your phone numbers, calendar, etc.

      1. Apps that require accounts to log in

         1. Any app that requires an account to log in will already be backed up, such as Duolingo, Pocket, Spotify

      1. Other apps
         Note: if you don’t have an SD card, you’ll need to make sure to copy these files off your phone before doing the factory reset
         - AntennaPod
           1. To back up your podcasts, go to _Menu_ > _Settings_ > _OPML export_ (near the bottom)
         - Tasks
           1. _Menu_ > _Settings_ > _Backups_ > _Backup directory_ > select the SD card (if you have one) > _Export tasks_

1. Do the factory reset

   **This will erase everything on your phone! Don’t do this until you have followed the above steps for making sure everything on your phone is backed up.**

   1. In the app menu go to _Settings_ > _Backup & reset_ > _Factory data reset_ > _Reset phone_

1. Log in to your Google account

   1. After doing the factory reset, log into the phone with your Google account during the initial setup process. This will restore your contacts and data for any Google apps you have installed

1. Reinstall apps

   1. Now reinstall any apps you would like. See here for a list of apps I recommend: [Android apps](../../../applications/android-apps)

1. Restore app data for apps that aren’t automatically backed up
   - AntennaPod
     1. _Menu_ > _Add Podcast_ > _OPML Import_
   - Tasks
     1. _Menu_ > _Settings_ > _Backups_ > _Backup directory_ > select the SD card (if you have one) > _Import tasks_
