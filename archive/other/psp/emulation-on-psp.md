title: Emulation on PSP
---

**Note:** Some of these emulators may be outdated or unmaintained. Before installing
any particular emulator, check these resources to see what the current recommendations
are:

- [Emulators List - 2019](http://wololo.net/talk/viewtopic.php?f=47&t=44039)
- [Emulators on PSP](http://emulation.gametechwiki.com/index.php/Emulators_on_PSP)

## Is the PSP a good device for emulation?

#### Advantages

- Convenient size
- Buttons are sized well (the Vita buttons are smaller)
- Plays PSP and most PlayStation 1 games natively
- Powerful enough to emulate most 8 and 16-bit consoles
- Second-hand systems are fairly inexpensive to purchase
- Buttons use rubber membranes (i.e. they're not clicky)
- Landscape orientation is comfortable to hold

#### Disadvantages

- Official replacement batteries are no longer available and most third-party batteries are low quality
  - The battery from Insten is okay but doesn't last nearly as long as the OEM battery
  - The battery from Cameron Sino lasts as long as the Insten battery but the battery temperature measurement is broken
  - Stay away from any batteries with a listed capacity higher than 1200/1800 mAh (e.g. 2400 mAh, 3600 mAh) as they are fakes with a very low capacity
- Build quality varies between models. The PSP-1000 seems to have good build quality, while the PSP-3000 is worse: shell is painted and the paint rubs off, battery cover pops off easily, system creaks a bit, connectors near some of the screws break easily, memory card sometimes disconnects during play
- Built-in Wifi doesn't work with newer Wifi standards
- PSP screens have noticeable ghosting, particularly the PSP-1000
- Due to the age of most PSP devices, many of them can be in rough shape
  - Replacement shells are available but they're nearly all very poor quality (parts don't fit together well, etc)

#### Other notes

- Uses a proprietary memory card, but an adaptor for a micro SD card can be purchased very cheaply

## Prerequisites

#### Install custom firmware (CFW)

See [https://pspunk.com/psp-cfw/](https://pspunk.com/psp-cfw/)

## RetroArch

#### System support

[http://emulation.gametechwiki.com/index.php/Emulators_on_PSP#RetroArch](http://emulation.gametechwiki.com/index.php/Emulators_on_PSP#RetroArch)

- Game Boy/Game Boy Color: Use Gambatte
- GBA: Use gpSP
  - Download a GBA BIOS and copy it to /PSP/RETROARCH/SYSTEM/gba_bios.bin (MD5: `a860e8c0b6d573d191e4ec7db1b1e4f6`)
  - Most games will require frame skipping. See the core options to enable it.
- NES: Use QuickNES
- SNES: Don't use RetroArch; see below for alternative options
- Sega Master System, Game Gear, Genesis/Mega Drive: Use Picodrive
  - In the core options, set the renderer to fast if needed to improve performance
  - In the core options, you can also set the sound quality to a lower value to improve performance

#### Install RetroArch

1. Download the latest package for PSP

   [https://retroarch.com/?page=platforms](https://retroarch.com/?page=platforms)

1. On the PSP, create a folder under /PSP/GAME/, e.g. /PSP/GAME/RetroArch

1. Extract the package and copy the contents to the folder you created

   - For example, you should see this file on your PSP: /PSP/GAME/RetroArch/EBOOT.PBP

1. (Recommended) Remove unusable cores. In the RetroArch/cores folder:
   - Delete mgba_libretro.PBP
     - It runs too slow on the PSP to be usable. Use gpSP instead
   - Delete fceumm_libretro.PBP
     - Use QuickNES instead

#### Buttons

- To return to the RetroArch menu while in a game, press and hold Start for a few seconds
  - To change this, go to _Settings_ > _Input_ > _Menu Toggle Gamepad Combo_
- By default, O button is select, X is cancel
  - To change this, go to _Settings_ > _Input_ > _Menu Swap OK & Cancel Buttons_
